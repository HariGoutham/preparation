## 🎨 Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices and are categorized into three types:

### 🛠️ Creational Patterns
Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms. Common creational patterns include:
- **Builder**
- **Simple Factory**
- **Factory Method**
- **Prototype**
- **Abstract Factory**
- **Singleton**
- **Object Pool**

### 🏗️ Structural Patterns
Structural patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Common structural patterns include:
- **Adapter**
- **Bridge**
- **Decorator**
- **Composite**
- **Facade**
- **Flyweight**
- **Proxy**

### 🤝 Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Common behavioral patterns include:
- **Chain of Responsibility**
- **Command**
- **Interpreter**
- **Mediator**
- **Iterator**
- **Memento**
- **Observer**
- **State**
- **Strategy**
- **Template**
- **Visitor**
- **Null Object**

## 🔑 SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They are:
- **S** - Single Responsibility Principle
- **O** - Open/Closed Principle
- **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle
- **I** - Interface Segregation Principle
- **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle

## 🔍 Problem Patterns

Problem patterns are common approaches to solving coding challenges. Understanding these patterns can help in efficiently tackling problems. Key patterns include:
- **Searching and Traversal Techniques**
  - **Breadth First Search (BFS)**: Useful for problems involving shortest paths in unweighted graphs, level order traversal in trees, and finding connected components.
  - **Depth First Search (DFS)**: Commonly used in tree and graph traversal, solving puzzles, and problems that require exploring all possible configurations.
  - **Modified Binary Search**: Effective for searching in sorted arrays, especially when the array has been modified (e.g., rotated).

- **Pointer Techniques**
  - **Fast and Slow Pointer**: Great for detecting cycles in linked lists and finding the middle of a linked list.
  - **Two Pointers**: Often used in problems involving arrays or strings where you need to compare elements or find pairs (e.g., two-sum problems).
  - **Sliding Window**: Useful for problems that require finding subarrays or substrings that meet certain criteria, such as maximum/minimum sums or counts.

- **Sorting and Merging Techniques**
  - **Merge Intervals**: Ideal for problems that involve overlapping intervals, such as meeting room scheduling.
  - **Cyclic Sort**: Efficient for sorting problems where the range of numbers is limited, often used in problems involving permutations.
  - **K-way Merge**: Useful for merging multiple sorted lists, such as merging k sorted arrays.

- **Dynamic Programming and Optimization**
  - **0/1 Knapsack**: A classic dynamic programming problem that teaches how to make optimal choices under constraints.
  - **Unbounded Knapsack**: Similar to the 0/1 Knapsack but allows for unlimited item choices, useful for resource allocation problems.
  - **Top 'K' elements**: Helps in efficiently finding the largest or smallest elements in a dataset.

- **Data Structures and Algorithms**
  - **Two Heaps**: Useful for problems that require median finding or dynamic range queries.
  - - **Monotonic Stack**: Often used in problems involving next greater/smaller elements, and range queries.
  - **Topological Sort**: Essential for ordering tasks with dependencies, such as course scheduling.

- **Combinatorial and Backtracking Techniques**
  - **Subsets**: Useful for problems that require generating combinations or permutations of a set.
  - **Backtracking**: A powerful technique for solving constraint satisfaction problems, puzzles, and combinatorial problems.

- **Graph and Matrix Techniques**
  - **Islands (Matrix Traversal)**: Useful for problems involving connected components in a grid, such as counting islands or regions.

- **Bit Manipulation**
  - **Bitwise XOR**: Often used in problems requiring efficient pairing or toggling of bits, such as finding unique elements.

- **Linked List Techniques**
  - **In-place Reversal of Linked List**: A common technique for linked list manipulation, especially in problems that require reversing nodes.
