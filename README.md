## 🎨 Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices and are categorized into three types:

### 🛠️ Creational Patterns
Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms. Common creational patterns include:
- **Builder**
- **Simple Factory**
- **Factory Method**
- **Prototype**
- **Abstract Factory**
- **Singleton**
- **Object Pool**

### 🏗️ Structural Patterns
Structural patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Common structural patterns include:
- **Adapter**
- **Bridge**
- **Decorator**
- **Composite**
- **Facade**
- **Flyweight**
- **Proxy**

### 🤝 Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Common behavioral patterns include:
- **Chain of Responsibility**
- **Command**
- **Interpreter**
- **Mediator**
- **Iterator**
- **Memento**
- **Observer**
- **State**
- **Strategy**
- **Template**
- **Visitor**
- **Null Object**

## 🔑 SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They are:
- **S** - Single Responsibility Principle
- **O** - Open/Closed Principle
- **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle
- **I** - Interface Segregation Principle
- **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle
