## 🎨 Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices and are categorized into three types:

### 🛠️ Creational Patterns
Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms. Common creational patterns include:
- **Singleton**
- **Factory Method**
- **Abstract Factory**
- **Builder**
- **Prototype**

### 🏗️ Structural Patterns
Structural patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Common structural patterns include:
- **Adapter**
- **Composite**
- **Proxy**
- **Flyweight**
- **Facade**

### 🤝 Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Common behavioral patterns include:
- **Observer**
- **Strategy**
- **Command**
- **Iterator**
- **State**

## 🔑 SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They are:
- **S** - Single Responsibility Principle
- **O** - Open/Closed Principle
- **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle
- **I** - Interface Segregation Principle
- **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle

## 📊 Data Structures and Algorithms

This section covers fundamental data structures and algorithms necessary for efficient problem-solving. Key topics include:
- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Trees** (Binary Trees, BST, AVL Trees)
- **Graphs**
- **Hash Tables**
- **Sorting Algorithms** (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- **Searching Algorithms** (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)

## 🔍 Problem Patterns

Problem patterns are common approaches to solving coding challenges. Understanding these patterns can help in efficiently tackling problems. Key patterns include:
- **Sliding Window**
- **Two Pointers**
- **Fast and Slow Pointers**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Backtracking**
- **Dynamic Programming**
