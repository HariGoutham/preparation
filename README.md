## Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices and are categorized into three types:

### Creational Patterns
Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. Common creational patterns include:
- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

### Structural Patterns
Structural patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Common structural patterns include:
- Adapter
- Composite
- Proxy
- Flyweight
- Facade

### Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Common behavioral patterns include:
- Observer
- Strategy
- Command
- Iterator
- State

## SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They are:
- **S** - Single Responsibility Principle
- **O** - Open/Closed Principle
- **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle
- **I** - Interface Segregation Principle
- **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle

## Data Structures and Algorithms

This section covers fundamental data structures and algorithms necessary for efficient problem-solving. Key topics include:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, BST, AVL Trees)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Sorting Algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)

## Problem Patterns

Problem patterns are common approaches to solving coding challenges. Understanding these patterns can help in efficiently tackling problems. Key patterns include:
- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Fast and Slow Pointers
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming

## LeetCode 75

LeetCode 75 is a curated list of 75 essential coding problems that cover a wide range of topics and are commonly asked in technical interviews. This list helps in practicing and mastering key concepts.
