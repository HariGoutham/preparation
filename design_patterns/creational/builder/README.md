# üåà Builder Pattern in Java

## üé® Overview

The **Builder Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** that allows for the step-by-step construction of complex objects. It provides a clear and readable way to create objects with many parameters, especially when some parameters are optional.

### üçî Real-World Analogy

Think of building a sandwich. You can choose the type of bread, add various fillings, and select condiments. Each step is independent, allowing you to customize your sandwich as you like. This is similar to how the Builder Pattern allows for the step-by-step construction of objects.

## üîß Problem Solved

The Builder Pattern addresses several issues:

- **Complex Object Construction**: Simplifies the creation of objects with many parameters.
- **Immutable Objects**: Facilitates the creation of immutable objects.
- **Readability and Clarity**: Improves code readability through a fluent interface.
- **Encapsulation of Construction Logic**: Separates construction logic from the object itself.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for different configurations without multiple constructors.
- **Avoiding Constructor Overloading**: Reduces confusion from overloaded constructors.

## üì¶ Example: NutritionFacts Class

Here‚Äôs an example implementation of the Builder Pattern in Java for a `NutritionFacts` class.

### üìù NutritionFacts Class Code

```java
public class NutritionFacts {
    private final int servingSize;  // (mL)
    private final int servings;      // (per container)
    private final int calories;      // (per serving)
    private final int fat;           // (g/serving)
    private final int sodium;        // (mg/serving)
    private final int carbohydrate;  // (g/serving)

    public static class Builder {
        // Required parameters
        private final int servingSize;  // (mL)
        private final int servings;      // (per container)

        // Optional parameters - initialized to default values
        private int calories     = 0;  // (per serving)
        private int fat          = 0;  // (g/serving)
        private int sodium       = 0;  // (mg/serving)
        private int carbohydrate = 0;  // (g/serving)

        public Builder(int servingSize, int servings) {
            this.servingSize = servingSize;
            this.servings = servings;
        }

        public Builder calories(int val) {
            calories = val;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder fat(int val) {
            fat = val;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder sodium(int val) {
            sodium = val;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder carbohydrate(int val) {
            carbohydrate = val;
            return this;
        }

        public NutritionFacts build() {
            return new NutritionFacts(this);
        }
    }

    private NutritionFacts(Builder builder) {
        servingSize = builder.servingSize;
        servings = builder.servings;
        calories = builder.calories;
        fat = builder.fat;
        sodium = builder.sodium;
        carbohydrate = builder.carbohydrate;
    }
}

üõ†Ô∏è Using the Builder Pattern
Here‚Äôs how you would create an instance of NutritionFacts using the Builder Pattern:

```java
NutritionFacts cocaCola = new NutritionFacts.Builder(240, 8)
                                .calories(100)
                                .sodium(35)
                                .carbohydrate(27)
                                .build();

üåü Visualization
üé• Suggested Animations
Step-by-Step Construction:

Create an animation showing the process of building a sandwich, where each ingredient is added one at a time. This can parallel the method chaining in the Builder Pattern.
Object Creation Flow:

Animate the flow of creating a NutritionFacts object, highlighting how each method call sets a property, culminating in the final object.
Comparison of Constructors:

Show a side-by-side comparison of a constructor with many parameters versus the Builder Pattern, emphasizing readability and clarity.
üèÅ Conclusion
The Builder Pattern is a powerful design pattern that simplifies the creation of complex objects while improving code readability and maintainability. By using a builder, you can create flexible and immutable objects with ease. This pattern is especially useful in scenarios where an object requires many parameters, some of which may be optional, allowing for a clear and concise way to construct such objects.
